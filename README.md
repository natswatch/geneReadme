 A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. 
README will display a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions. The license for the application is also displayed, including a badge for that license. A section called Questions will include the user's Github and email address. A table of contents will be available to easily navigate through the generated markdown document.
